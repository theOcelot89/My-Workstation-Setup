# My-Workstation-Setup
 Config files, drivers and other staff for setting up workstation after format/pc change

## Git
For **git global .gitconfig**, put the .gitconfig from the repo to your **$home** directory (git looks only in this place for the local(user) config).\
For **git bash** to have a desired prompt (but not from .bashrc in order to maintain the **git** track prompt) put the **git prompt** inside programfiles/Git/etc/profile.d in windows 10.
